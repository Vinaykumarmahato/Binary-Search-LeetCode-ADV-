📁 This repository contains my solutions to the Binary Search Tree challenges on LeetCode. Each challenge provides a problem statement and the goal is to implement the solution using the concepts and techniques related to binary search trees.

## 📝 Challenge Descriptions
### 🎯 Challenge 1: Invert Binary Tree

📝 **Problem Statement:** Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree (mirror image of the original tree) and return its root.

💡 **Solution:** Implemented a recursive approach to swap the left and right child nodes at each level.

### 🎯 Challenge 2: Validate Binary Search Tree

📝 **Problem Statement:** Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

💡 **Solution:** Utilized a recursive approach to validate each node, ensuring that all values in the left subtree are smaller and all values in the right subtree are larger than the current node's value.

### 🎯 Challenge 3: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

📝 **Problem Statement:** Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

💡 **Solution:** Implemented a recursive approach to traverse the tree and identify the LCA based on the values of the given nodes.
